# Veritas

Veritas is a source of truth system designed to be integrated with infrastructure automation systems like ansible. The goal is to have a networked source of truth that a playbook can gather facts from to apply to a given server. This attempts to add the benefit of having a centrally controlled configuration point without needing an agent installed on the target system.

## TO DO
